# Hostel Management System (MERN Stack)

A comprehensive Hostel Management System designed to streamline hostel operations, developed with the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The application simplifies student registration, hostel allocations, complaints, notices, batch management, and offers intuitive portals for admins, wardens, and students.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (with Redux for state management)
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose for schema modeling)
- **Deployment:** Netlify (frontend)
- **Other Tools:** Chart libraries for visualizations

## 🗂️ Folder Structure Overview

### backend/
- `index.js` — Entry point for the server
- `controllers/` — Business logic for modules (admin, batch, complain, hostel, notice, student, warden)
- `models/` — Mongoose schemas for entities
- `routes/route.js` — API route definitions
- `package.json` — Backend dependencies

### frontend/
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI elements (charts, dialogs, tables)
- `src/pages/` — Pages for different roles (admin, student, warden)
- `src/redux/` — State logic for each module
- `src/contexts/` — Context API for theming
- `src/assets/` — Images and SVGs
- `public/` — Static assets
- `netlify.toml` — Netlify deployment config
- `package.json` — Frontend dependencies

## 🚦 Main Features & Workflow

### 1. **User Roles**
- **Admin:** Manages hostels, batches, students, notices, wardens
- **Warden:** Manages students, batches, and complaints
- **Student:** Views hostels, submits complaints, checks attendance and notices

### 2. **Authentication**
- Role-based login and registration for each user type
- Smart dashboard redirection post-login

### 3. **Core Modules**
- **Student Management:** Register/view/manage students
- **Hostel Allocation:** Assign students, manage hostel details
- **Batch Management:** Create/manage batches
- **Complaint System:** Students submit, wardens/admins resolve complaints
- **Notice Board:** Admins post, all can view
- **Attendance Tracking:** View (students), manage (admins/wardens)

### 4. **Data Flow**
- **Frontend:** React interacts with Redux, API calls via Axios/fetch
- **Backend:** Express routes → controllers → MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Database:** MongoDB stores all entities (students, hostels, complaints, etc.)

### 5. **UI/UX**
- Fully responsive and modern interface
- Visual dashboards with charts and tables
- Clear, role-based navigation for Admin, Warden, Student

## 🔁 Example Workflow

1. **Student Registration:** Admin registers students.
2. **Hostel Allocation:** Admin assigns to hostel.
3. **Complaint Submission:** Student submits via dashboard.
4. **Complaint Resolution:** Warden views and resolves complaint.
5. **Notice Posting:** Admin posts notice, all can access it.

## 💬 Explaining in Interviews

- **Problem Statement:** Simplifies and digitizes hostel administration.
- **Tech Stack Choice:** MERN for full-stack JavaScript compatibility, rapid development, and scalability.
- **User Journeys:** Walk through how admins, wardens, and students interact with the system’s modules.
- **Data Flow:** React (UI) → Redux (state) → Express (API server) → MongoDB (DB)
- **Unique Points:** Role-based dashboards, advanced complaint handling, visual analytics.
- **Deployment:** Frontend on Netlify, backend runs Node.js server (cloud/VPS).

Controllers in the MERN Stack Project
# Controllers in the MERN Stack Project

In this MERN stack project, **controllers** are key backend modules responsible for handling the core functionality associated with specific resources or features. They serve as the middle layer between **routes** (which define the API endpoints) and **models** (which communicate with the MongoDB database).

## 🔍 Features of Controllers

- **Request Handling:**  
  Accept incoming HTTP requests from routes, process the data, and return appropriate responses.

- **Business Logic:**  
  Implement the core application logic for each feature, such as student registration or complaint resolution.

- **Database Operations:**  
  Use Mongoose models to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on the MongoDB database.

- **Validation & Error Handling:**  
  Check the validity of incoming data and handle errors gracefully to ensure robustness.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Keep the backend code organized by isolating business logic from route definitions.

## 🗂️ Usage in This Project

- Controller files reside in the `controllers/` directory, e.g., `admin-controller.js`, `student_controller.js`, `complain-controller.js`.
- Each controller manages the logic for a specific module or resource (admin, student, hostel, etc.).

### Example Flow

1. A route defined in `routes/route.js` receives a request, for example:  
   ```js
   router.post('/students', studentController.createStudent);
   ```
2. The route calls the relevant controller function (`createStudent` in `student_controller.js`).
3. The controller processes the request: validates input, interacts with the database via the model (`studentSchema.js`), and sends back a response indicating success, error, or data results.

This modular approach makes the backend codebase **clean**, **maintainable**, and **easy to test**.

## Example (Simplified)

```js
// In routes/route.js
router.post('/students', studentController.createStudent);

// In controllers/student_controller.js
exports.createStudent = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Validate request data
    // Use Student model to save data to DB
    // Send success response
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error' });
  }
};
```

### Summary

Controllers handle API requests, encapsulate business logic, communicate with the database, and return HTTP responses. They enforce separation of concerns, keeping routing and logic distinct and contributing to a scalable, maintainable backend architecture.

In this MERN stack project, a **model** defines how data is structured and stored in MongoDB and provides the methods to interact with that data. Models are created using **Mongoose**, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB.

## Features of Models

- **Schema Definition:**  
  Models specify the fields, data types, and validation rules for each resource, such as students or hostels.

- **Database Interaction:**  
  They provide methods to create, read, update, and delete documents in the database.

- **Data Validation:**  
  Models ensure data integrity by enforcing required fields, proper types, and custom validations before saving.

- **Relationships:**  
  Models can define references to other models, for example, linking a student to a hostel or batch.

- **Reusable Logic:**  
  You can add static or instance methods for common database operations within the model.

## How Models Are Used in This Project

- Models are located in the `models/` directory (e.g., `studentSchema.js`, `hostelSchema.js`, `complainSchema.js`).
- Each model file defines a **Mongoose schema** for a specific resource.
- Controllers import these models to perform database operations like queries or saving data.
- By defining schemas, models ensure data consistency and validity.

### Example Flow

1. A controller imports the model:  
   ```js
   const Student = require('../models/studentSchema');
   ```
2. The controller calls model methods to interact with the database, for example:  
   ```js
   Student.find();
   Student.create(data);
   ```
3. Mongoose validates the data against the schema before saving it to MongoDB.

## Example (Simplified)

```js
// In models/studentSchema.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const studentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  hostel: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Hostel' },
  // ...other fields...
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Student', studentSchema);
```

### Summary

Models in this project define the data structure and rules stored in MongoDB. They play a crucial role by enabling controllers to perform database operations while ensuring data integrity and consistent application data throughout the system.
