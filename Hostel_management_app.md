Hostel Management System (MERN Stack)
A comprehensive Hostel Management System designed to streamline hostel operations, developed with the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The application simplifies student registration, hostel allocations, complaints, notices, batch management, and offers intuitive portals for admins, wardens, and students.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (with Redux for state management)

Backend: Node.js & Express.js

Database: MongoDB (Mongoose for schema modeling)

Deployment: Netlify (frontend)

Other Tools: Chart libraries for visualizations

🚦 Main Features & Workflow
1. User Roles
Admin: Manages hostels, batches, students, notices, wardens

Warden: Manages students, batches, and complaints

Student: Views hostels, submits complaints, checks attendance and notices

Batch Management: Create/manage batches

Complaint System: Students submit, wardens/admins resolve complaints

Notice Board: Admins post, all can view

Attendance Tracking: View (students), manage (admins/wardens)

4. Data Flow
Frontend: React interacts with Redux, API calls via Axios/fetch

Backend: Express routes → controllers → MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Database: MongoDB stores all entities (students, hostels, complaints, etc.)

5. UI/UX
