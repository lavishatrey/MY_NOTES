# General & Architecture

**Q: What is the main purpose of your project?**  
A: The main purpose is to automate and streamline hostel management tasks such as student registration, hostel allocation, complaint handling, notice posting, and attendance tracking for admins, wardens, and students.

**Q: Why did you choose the MERN stack for this application?**  
A: MERN stack offers a unified JavaScript environment for both frontend and backend, making development faster and easier. MongoDB is flexible for storing complex data, Express and Node.js provide a robust backend, and React enables a dynamic, responsive UI.

**Q: Can you explain the overall architecture and workflow of your system?**  
A: The frontend (React) interacts with the backend (Node.js/Express) via RESTful APIs. The backend uses controllers, models, and routes to process requests and interact with MongoDB. Redux manages frontend state, and Axios handles API calls. JWT tokens secure protected routes.

**Q: How does the frontend communicate with the backend?**  
A: The frontend uses Axios to send HTTP requests to backend API endpoints. Responses are handled in Redux thunks, updating the UI accordingly.

# Backend

**Q: What are controllers, models, and routes? How do they interact?**  
A: Controllers contain business logic, models define data schemas and interact with MongoDB, and routes map HTTP requests to controller functions. Routes receive requests, call controllers, which use models to access or modify data.

**Q: How do you handle authentication and authorization?**  
A: Authentication is handled using JWT tokens. On login, the backend generates a token, which the frontend stores and sends with protected requests. Middleware verifies the token before allowing access.

**Q: How is data validated before being stored in MongoDB?**  
A: Mongoose schemas define required fields and validation rules. Controllers also perform additional checks before saving data.

**Q: What is the role of Mongoose in your backend?**  
A: Mongoose provides schema-based modeling for MongoDB, handles data validation, and simplifies CRUD operations.

**Q: How do you manage errors and exceptions in your backend?**  
A: Errors are caught in controllers and returned as structured responses. Database connection errors are logged, and API errors are sent with appropriate status codes.

**Q: How do you structure your API endpoints?**  
A: Endpoints are RESTful and organized by resource, e.g., /StudentReg, /HostelCreate, /NoticeList/:id. Each endpoint maps to a specific controller function.

# Frontend

**Q: How is state managed in your React application?**  
A: State is managed globally using Redux. Each feature has its own slice, and actions are dispatched to update state.

**Q: What is Redux and why did you use it?**  
A: Redux is a state management library that centralizes application state, making it easier to manage, debug, and share data across components.

**Q: How do you fetch data from the backend?**  
A: Data is fetched using Axios in Redux thunks or handle files. API responses update the Redux store, which updates the UI.

**Q: What hooks do you use and for what purposes?**  
A: I use useState for local state, useEffect for side effects, useDispatch to send Redux actions, useSelector to read Redux state, and useContext for global context values like theme.

**Q: How do you handle user roles and access control in the UI?**  
A: Role-based navigation and conditional rendering ensure users only see features relevant to their role (admin, student, warden).

**Q: How do you provide feedback to users (loading, errors, success)?**  
A: Loading spinners, error messages, and success notifications are shown based on Redux state and API responses.

# Security

**Q: How are JWT tokens generated and used in your project?**  
A: JWT tokens are generated on successful login by the backend and sent to the frontend. The frontend stores the token and includes it in the Authorization header for protected API requests.

**Q: How do you protect sensitive routes and data?**  
A: Protected routes require a valid JWT token, verified by backend middleware before processing the request.

**Q: Where do you store JWT tokens on the frontend?**  
A: JWT tokens are typically stored in localStorage or Redux state for use in API requests.

# Features & Functionality

**Q: Can you walk me through the workflow for student registration?**  
A: The admin fills out a registration form. The frontend sends the data to the backend via Axios. The backend validates and saves the student in MongoDB, then returns a success response.

**Q: How does the complaint system work?**  
A: Students submit complaints via a form. The complaint is sent to the backend, stored in the database, and can be viewed and resolved by wardens/admins.

**Q: How do admins/wardens manage hostels and batches?**  
A: Admins/wardens use dashboards to create, update, and delete hostels and batches. Actions trigger API calls that update the database.

**Q: How is attendance tracked and updated?**  
A: Attendance data is managed via forms and tables. Updates are sent to the backend, which modifies the relevant student records.

**Q: How are notices created and displayed?**  
A: Admins create notices via a form. Notices are stored in the backend and fetched by students/wardens to display in their dashboards.

# Deployment & DevOps

**Q: How did you deploy your frontend and backend?**  
A: The frontend is deployed on Netlify, and the backend runs on a Node.js server, possibly hosted on a cloud platform.

**Q: What environment variables do you use and why?**  
A: Environment variables store sensitive data like database URLs, JWT secrets, and API base URLs to keep them secure and configurable.

**Q: How do you handle CORS issues?**  
A: CORS is configured in the backend to allow requests from the frontendâ€™s domain and handle credentials.

# Optimization & Best Practices

**Q: How do you ensure your code is maintainable and scalable?**  
A: I use modular folder structure, separate concerns (controllers, models, routes), reusable components, and follow best practices for naming and documentation.

**Q: What challenges did you face during development and how did you solve them?**  
A: Challenges included managing complex state, handling authentication, and ensuring data consistency. I solved these by using Redux, JWT, and thorough validation.

**Q: How would you improve this project if you had more time?**  
A: I would add automated tests, improve error handling, optimize performance, and enhance the UI/UX.

# Miscellaneous

**Q: What libraries or tools did you use for data visualization?**  
A: I used chart libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for visualizing data in dashboards.

**Q: How do you handle form validation on both frontend and backend?**  
A: Frontend uses controlled components and validation logic; backend uses Mongoose schema validation and additional checks in controllers.

**Q: How do you test your application?**  
A: Manual testing for UI and API endpoints; automated tests can be added using Jest for backend and React Testing Library for frontend.
